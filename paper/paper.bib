We then apply halo-optics to the 3D spatial positions of halo particles within four separate synthetic Milky Way-type galaxies, classifying the stellar and dark matter structural hierarchies. Through visualization of the halo-optics output, we compare its structure identification to the state-of-the-art galaxy/(sub)halo finder VELOCIraptor , finding excellent agreement even though halo-optics does not consider kinematic information in this current implementation. We conclude that halo-optics is a robust hierarchical halo finder, although its determination of lower spatial-density features such as the tails of streams could be improved with the inclusion of extra localized information such as particle kinematics and stellar metallicity into its distance metric.}",

It is designed to improve upon H alo-OPTICS – an algorithm that automatically detects and extracts significant astrophysical clusters from the 3D spatial positions of simulation particles – by decreasing run-times, possessing the capability for metric adaptivity, and being readily applicable to data with any number of features. We directly compare these algorithms and find that not only does C luSTAR-ND produce a similarly robust clustering structure, it does so in a run-time that is at least 3 orders of magnitude faster. In optimizing C luSTAR-ND’s clustering performance, we have also carefully calibrated 4 of the 7 C luSTAR-ND parameters which – unless specified by the user – will be automatically and optimally chosen based on the input data. We conclude that C luSTAR-ND is a robust astrophysical clustering algorithm that can be leveraged to find stellar satellite groups on large synthetic or observational data sets.}",
